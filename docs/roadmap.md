# Roadmap

Milestones for Dalica and their task blocks, with task ids used in commit subjects (`M1.3: …`).
This file is the plan; the live state of every task (ready, claimed, in review, done) is the
GitHub task board, kept in sync by `cargo xtask tasks` ([`task-board.md`](task-board.md)). Agents
get work with `cargo xtask tasks next`, never by scanning this file.

Status legend: ✅ done · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ not started. Task blocks use only ⬜ and ✅; their live
state (ready, claimed, in review) is on the task board ([`task-board.md`](task-board.md)).

## Where we stand

*Honest assessment, 2026-10-10. Agents: read this before picking work. Update it only with
measured facts, dated.*

*2026-10-10 (M1.A).* The whole data path of M1 works headlessly on all three OSes: a folder of
photos is scanned by content (bounded; links and special files handled), its sidecars are read,
stars change through `Session::execute` with one undo step each, every change is journalled and
written back to `.dalica.json` (debounced, atomic, unknown keys kept), and deleting the index and
rebuilding gives the same stars. `cargo xtask accept M1 --headless` passes in 1.7 s; `panic_hunt`
fuzzes all 10 commands without a panic; the workspace has 285 tests, `cargo xtask ci` takes 95 s
cold and 21 s warm on a fresh clone. The tests found and fixed five real bugs (a job pool losing
work, scans hanging on FIFOs, sidecar floats drifting, sub-pixel rectangles off by one, a board sync
failure). There is no UI yet beyond M0's empty window: M1.16–M1.19 add the widgets, the headless
driver and the plain library window. Next: M1.16, through the full board loop for the first time.

*2026-10-09.* M0 is done pending its review. The workspace has the 18 crates of `architecture.md` §2
as stubs plus the two apps, and every gate bites: `cargo xtask ci` (fmt, clippy, tests, layers, deps,
assets, names, parity, docs, roadmap parse) is green on Linux, Windows and macOS (GitHub CI 2–5 min
per OS cold, under a minute warm on Linux and macOS; 46 s on a clean local clone), and
`cargo xtask accept M0` shows 6/6 planted violations caught. The task board (`cargo xtask tasks`)
adopted the 32 bootstrap issues without duplicates and closes merged tasks; its claim, submit and
merge paths have only run against the in-memory fake. `dalica` opens an empty 1400 × 900 window
(GL-free wgpu, no fonts bundled yet; the title text is missing on GNOME until M3's own title bar).
There is no product code yet. Next: M1, the first real data path from a folder to a starred photo
that survives a restart.

Before that (kickoff, 2026-10-09): the reference organizer was documented privately in `notes/`,
the public specs in `docs/` describe Dalica, the scope was trimmed (dated features dropped), the
kickoff decisions were recorded and the architecture was specified (`architecture.md`).

## How milestones work

- **Small and checkable.** A milestone is one feature area, about 3–8 tasks, each task one agent
  session. It ends in something the maintainer can run and look at.
- **Every milestone has an acceptance check:** `cargo xtask accept M<n>` runs that milestone's
  acceptance tests and scripts (`dalica-cli run` / `snapshot` scripts under `tests/acceptance/`)
  and prints what a human should look at. Its *Done when* line says what it proves. Acceptance
  checks of earlier milestones keep running in `cargo xtask ci`, so nothing silently regresses.
- **Review after each milestone.** Every milestone ends with a review gate task `M<n>.R` owned by
  the maintainer (bigger milestones may add checkpoint gates such as `M1.A`). When a milestone's
  check passes: write the dated *Where we stand* paragraph, review with the maintainer what was
  learned, adjust the following milestones, and write the next milestone's task blocks. The next
  milestone's first tasks list `M<n>.R` in `after:`, so no agent can start them before the
  maintainer closes the review issue.
- **Metrics** a task measures go in its dev-log entry and pull request; the lead copies them into
  `status.md` (done-whens never write it). Steps only the maintainer can do (approving a live board
  run, a push, a manual look) belong to the review gates or the lead, not to a worker's done-when.
- **Tasks are blocks in a fixed format** (`after`, `owner`, `files`, `scope`, `done when`;
  [`task-board.md`](task-board.md) §3). This file is the plan; the **live state** (ready, claimed,
  in review, done) is the GitHub task board that `cargo xtask tasks` keeps in sync with it.
- **Agents.** M0 and M1 are built by a single agent. From M2 on, up to 8 agents on the
  maintainer's machine pick tasks from the board (one lead integrator, the rest workers;
  `AGENTS.md` §7).
- Phases group milestones for orientation only; the order inside a phase may change at a review.

## Milestones

### M0 — Skeleton and gates

- **Goal:** an empty workspace where every quality gate already bites, so every later commit lands
  on green.
- **In:** Cargo workspace with every crate of `architecture.md` §2 as a stub (crate roots with the
  never-crash attributes, a README each); `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.98), `clippy.toml`,
  `rustfmt.toml`; `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE`; `xtask`: `ci`, `layers`, `deps`, `assets`,
  `names`, `parity` (structure only), `accept`; GitHub Actions running `cargo xtask ci` on Linux,
  Windows and macOS; the task board (`xtask tasks`, [`task-board.md`](task-board.md)); `AGENTS.md` and
  the private dev log; `dalica` opens an empty window titled
  Dalica on the `chrome` colour and quits cleanly; `dalica-cli --version` and `commands` (`[]`).
- **Out:** any feature, theme beyond one colour, commands, control channel, packaging.
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask ci` is green on a clean clone locally and on all three CI runners;
  `cargo xtask accept M0` proves each gate fails when it should (in a temporary copy: a layer
  violation, an `unwrap()` in non-test code, an unlisted PNG, the reference product's name in a
  file, a `*-sys` dependency, a `std::fs::write` outside `fs`); you run `cargo run -p dalica` and
  see the empty window.

#### M0 tasks

Task blocks use the fixed format of [`task-board.md`](task-board.md) §3; `cargo xtask tasks sync`
turns each into a GitHub issue. M0 is built by a single agent.

- ✅ **M0.1 Workspace skeleton**
  - after: —
  - files: `Cargo.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE`, `.gitignore`, `crates/**`, `apps/**`, `tests/acceptance/**`
  - scope: workspace members `crates/*`, `apps/*`, `xtask`, `tests/acceptance`;
    `[workspace.package]` (version 0.0.0, edition 2024, `rust-version = "1.98"`, licence
    `MIT OR Apache-2.0`); `[workspace.dependencies]` with the versions of `architecture.md` §1;
    `panic = "unwind"`; `[profile.dev] debug = "line-tables-only"` (keeps 8 agents' target
    directories small); `rust-toolchain.toml`; licence files; every crate of `architecture.md` §2
    as `Cargo.toml` + `README.md` + `src/lib.rs` with `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` and the never-crash
    `deny` list; `apps/dalica`, `apps/dalica-cli`; an empty `tests/acceptance` crate.
  - done when: `cargo build --workspace --all-targets` and `cargo test --workspace` pass, and
    `tests/acceptance/m0_skeleton.rs` asserts every crate root has both attributes and
    `cargo metadata` lists exactly the 18 crates, 2 apps, `xtask` and `dalica-acceptance`.
- ✅ **M0.2 `xtask` frame and `layers`**
  - after: M0.1
  - files: `xtask/Cargo.toml`, `xtask/src/main.rs`, `xtask/src/layers.rs`, `xtask/src/metadata.rs`
  - scope: subcommand dispatch; the layer table of `architecture.md` §2 and rules 1–4 (downward
    normal deps with listed exceptions; dev-deps downward plus `scenes`; UI crates only in L5 and
    apps; `std::fs` write calls only in `crates/fs`); unregistered crates fail; reads
    `cargo metadata` JSON.
  - done when: `cargo xtask layers` passes on the tree, and unit tests on synthetic metadata and
    sources fail naming the crate and rule for `library → engine`, `egui` in `engine`, an
    unregistered crate, `std::fs::write` in `crates/store`, and `scenes` as a normal dependency of
    `core`.
- ✅ **M0.10 Task board: `xtask tasks`**
  - after: M0.2
  - files: `xtask/src/tasks/**`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**`
  - scope: everything in [`task-board.md`](task-board.md): the roadmap task parser; `setup`,
    `sync`, `next`, `claim`, `submit`, `release`, `status`, `merge`, `log`; the local claim lock in
    the git common directory; a `GitHub` trait with a `gh`-CLI implementation and an in-memory
    fake for tests. Running `setup` and the first `sync` against GitHub needs the maintainer's
    go-ahead (it creates milestones, labels, issues and project fields).
  - done when: `cargo test -p xtask` passes tests on the fake that show: every task block of
    `roadmap.md` parses (and a malformed block fails with its line number); `sync` run twice makes
    no second change; `next` never offers a task whose `after` is not done, whose `files` overlap
    a claimed task, or that belongs to a later milestone than the open review gate; 8 threads
    claiming the same task produce exactly one winner; a ✅ task with an open issue makes `sync`
    fail. Then, with approval, `cargo xtask tasks setup && cargo xtask tasks sync` creates the
    board and `cargo xtask tasks status` lists every M0 and M1 task.
- ✅ **M0.3 `xtask deps`**
  - after: M0.2
  - files: `xtask/src/deps.rs`
  - scope: licence allow-list (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2/3, ISC, Zlib, Unicode-3.0; MPL-2.0 only
    with a recorded reason); deny list (`openssl-sys`, `ring`, `aws-lc-sys`, `libz-sys`, …); any
    crate with a `cc`/`cmake` build dependency fails; `*-sys` crates only from an allow-list with a
    one-line reason each (e.g. `windows-sys`: bindings only, no C build).
  - done when: `cargo xtask deps` passes on the tree and unit tests reject a GPL crate,
    `openssl-sys`, an unknown `foo-sys`, and a crate whose build script depends on `cc`.
- ✅ **M0.4 `xtask names` and `assets`**
  - after: M0.2
  - files: `xtask/src/names.rs`, `xtask/src/assets.rs`
  - scope: `names` compares every tracked file's words and file names against SHA-256 hashes of
    the forbidden names (so the names never appear in the source; `AGENTS.md` is exempt);
    `assets` matches every image/font/sound/data file to an `ATTRIBUTION.md` row, checks licence
    files exist, and fails forbidden names and extensions.
  - done when: both pass on the tree and unit tests (temp dirs) fail on a planted forbidden word,
    a forbidden word in a file name, an unlisted `.png`, and a row pointing at a missing licence
    file; the same word inside `AGENTS.md` passes.
- ✅ **M0.5 `xtask ci`, `parity`, `accept`**
  - after: M0.3, M0.4
  - files: `xtask/src/ci.rs`, `xtask/src/parity.rs`, `xtask/src/accept.rs`
  - scope: `ci` = `fmt --check`, `clippy --workspace --all-targets -D warnings`, tests
    (parallelism from free RAM and `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS`), `layers`, `deps`, `assets`, `names`,
    `parity`, `tasks sync --check` (offline: parses the roadmap only), then `accept` for every
    finished milestone; `parity` checks ids, tiers, statuses, cited `cmd:` ids and paths, and
    `--write` refreshes the summary; `accept M<n>` runs `cargo test -p dalica-acceptance --test
    m<n>` and prints `tests/acceptance/m<n>.md`.
  - done when: `cargo xtask ci` is green; `cargo xtask parity --write` twice leaves no diff; unit
    tests show `parity` rejecting a duplicate id and an unknown status.
- ✅ **M0.6 Gates bite: `accept M0`**
  - after: M0.5
  - files: `tests/acceptance/m0.rs`, `tests/acceptance/m0.md`
  - scope: copy the tree to a temp dir (shared target dir), plant one violation at a time, expect
    the matching gate to fail, remove it, expect green: a layer violation, `unwrap()` in non-test
    code, an unlisted PNG, a forbidden name, a path dependency named `evil-sys`, `std::fs::write`
    outside `fs`.
  - done when: `cargo xtask accept M0` reports 6/6 gates bite and exits 0; the warm run time is
    recorded in `status.md` → Metrics.
- ✅ **M0.7 CI on three OSes**
  - after: M0.1
  - files: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - scope: matrix ubuntu / windows / macos; toolchain 1.98; dependency cache; the Linux packages
    eframe needs; `cargo xtask ci`; read-only token permissions; cancel superseded runs; runs on
    pull requests and pushes to `main`. Pushing needs the maintainer's go-ahead.
  - done when: a pushed branch shows the workflow green on all three runners (`gh run watch`);
    each runner's duration is recorded in `status.md` → Metrics.
- ✅ **M0.8 Empty window and CLI stubs**
  - after: M0.1
  - files: `apps/dalica/src/**`, `apps/dalica-cli/src/**`, `apps/dalica-cli/tests/**`, `crates/ui-kit/src/theme.rs`
  - scope: window titled "Dalica", 1400 × 900, minimum 900 × 600, `chrome` background (one
    token), clean quit, panic hook writing to the log; `dalica --version`, `dalica-cli --version`,
    `dalica-cli commands` (prints `[]`).
  - done when: `cargo test -p dalica-cli` checks `commands` prints `[]` and both `--version`
    outputs equal the workspace version; you run `cargo run -p dalica` and see the empty window.
- ✅ **M0.9 Docs match reality**
  - after: M0.5, M0.6, M0.7, M0.8, M0.10
  - files: `docs/development.md`, `docs/task-board.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/status.md`, `xtask/src/docs.rs`
  - scope: a `ci` step checking every `cargo xtask …` command named in `AGENTS.md`,
    `development.md` and `task-board.md` exists; status and metrics updated.
  - done when: `cargo xtask ci` (with the docs check) and `cargo xtask accept M0` pass on a clean
    clone.
- ✅ **M0.R Milestone review**
  - after: M0.9
  - owner: maintainer
  - files: `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/status.md`
  - scope: the maintainer runs the manual check, reviews what was learned and approves the M1
    task list (`roadmap.md` → How milestones work).
  - done when: the maintainer closes the review issue.

### M1 — Star a photo, end to end

- **Goal:** the core data path done properly once: a folder on disk → index → thumbnail grid →
  star → `.dalica.json` → survives a restart and an index rebuild. Every crate on that path exists
  for real, with its tests.
- **In:** `core` (ids, position keys, `Clock`); `fs` (atomic write + verify, lock, UI-thread guard,
  fault injection); `scenes`; `image` (JPEG and PNG, scaled JPEG decode, EXIF orientation,
  embedded EXIF thumbnails, decode limits); `sidecar` v1 (stars; unknown keys preserved);
  `library` (folders, photos, star op + inverse, revisions); `store` (journal + snapshot, debounced
  sidecar writer, `flush`, rebuild); `scan` (one-shot bounded walk + verification); `thumbs` (job
  pool, memory LRU); `engine` (Session, registry, command contract, library undo stack, keymap
  with contexts, minimal settings, `panic_hunt`); commands `folders.add`, `library.query`,
  `photo.inspect`, `photo.star.toggle` / `photo.star.set`, `edit.undo` / `edit.redo`,
  `library.rebuild`; `dalica-cli` `commands`, `run`, `inspect`, `snapshot`; `ui-kit` (first
  tokens, a few widgets, the CPU rasterizer); `ui` (a deliberately plain window: folder list, one
  square grid per folder, click to select, Ctrl+8 and a star button, the star badge, File → Add
  Folder…).
- **Out:** watching, tray and Hold, rotate and hide, the real section headers and layout, search,
  captions, writing metadata into files, the disk thumbnail cache, Folder Manager and first run,
  other formats, the control channel.
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M1` passes: a script adds a folder of 200 `scenes` JPEGs (all 8
  orientations) to a temporary library, stars 3 and undoes 1 → the folder's `.dalica.json` holds
  exactly 2 stars and keeps keys planted in it beforehand; after deleting the index and running
  `library.rebuild` the same 2 stars show; a second process on the same library is refused;
  fault-injection tests never leave a torn sidecar; `panic_hunt` is green; a headless snapshot
  shows 2 star badges (fingerprint). You run `cargo run -p dalica -- --demo`, star a photo with
  Ctrl+8, restart, and the badge is still there.

#### M1 tasks

M1 is deliberately the thickest milestone: every crate on the data path gets built for real once.
Review gate **M1.A (checkpoint A)** after M1.15 checks the whole path headlessly before any UI is
built. Built by a single agent; the waves show what could run in parallel later. After M1.A the
agent uses the full board loop (`claim`, `submit`, `merge`). The first fingerprints of the
repository (M1.16's widget gallery, M1.18/M1.19's star badges) are new baselines: the lead sends
their PNGs to the maintainer, who approves them before they merge (M1.A decision, 2026-10-10).

- ✅ **M1.1 `core`**
  - after: M0.R
  - files: `crates/core/**`
  - scope: id newtypes with serde; `Rect01` normalised geometry; `Clock` with system and virtual
    clocks; collision names (`name-001.ext`, next free); position keys (`after`, `between`).
  - done when: `cargo test -p dalica-core` passes, including property tests that `between(a, b)`
    sorts strictly between any `a < b`, that keys stay short after 10 000 inserts at one spot, and
    collision naming on empty, dot-only and non-ASCII names.
- ✅ **M1.2 `fs`: atomic writes**
  - after: M1.1
  - files: `crates/fs/src/atomic.rs`, `crates/fs/src/append.rs`, `crates/fs/src/guard.rs`, `crates/fs/src/faults.rs`, `crates/fs/src/lib.rs`, `crates/fs/Cargo.toml`
  - scope: atomic replace (temp in the same folder, write, fsync, rename, fsync the folder where
    supported, re-read and compare); read-before-write identity check; the UI-thread guard; named
    fault points behind the `faults` feature; an append-only, size-capped `append` (fsync after each
    write) and `rotate` (`name.log` → `name.1.log` → `name.2.log`) for log files, so the app's logger
    writes through `fs` too (layer rule 4).
  - done when: `cargo test -p dalica-fs --features faults` passes, including a loop that fails each
    fault point in turn and asserts the target holds exactly the old or the new bytes; a file
    changed between read and write is refused; any call on a thread marked as UI returns
    `Err(OnUiThread)`; `append` past its cap returns an error and leaves the file at or under the cap.
- ✅ **M1.3 `fs`: lock and walks**
  - after: M1.2
  - files: `crates/fs/src/lock.rs`, `crates/fs/src/walk.rs`, `crates/fs/tests/**`
  - scope: library lock file (std `File::try_lock`; `fs4` was dropped); bounded directory walk (depth 32, 1 000 000 entries,
    symlink-loop detection, caller-supplied skip rules, sorted entries).
  - done when: a second process (spawned test helper) gets `Err(Locked)` while the first holds
    the lock and succeeds after it exits; a symlink loop and a 40-deep tree end with a bounded
    result and a warning, not a hang; names with `]`, `"`, `;`, `=` and non-ASCII are listed.
- ✅ **M1.20 App log file**
  - after: M1.2
  - files: `apps/dalica/src/logging.rs`, `apps/dalica/Cargo.toml`
  - scope: the desktop app's log of `development.md` §10 written through `fs::append`:
    `<config>/logs/dalica.log`, rotated to `dalica.1.log` / `dalica.2.log` at each launch, capped at
    16 MiB, Dalica's crates at `info` and the rest at `warn`, `RUST_LOG` directives; the panic hook
    also appends to `dalica-panics.log` in the OS temp folder; `--version`, `--help` and
    command-line errors write no file.
  - done when: tests on a temp config dir show rotation across three launches, the cap holding,
    a panic's message and location in both files, and no file for `--version`.
- ✅ **M1.4 `scenes`**
  - after: M1.1
  - files: `crates/scenes/**`
  - scope: seeded procedural images (gradients, horizons, soft blobs) at any size; JPEG (via
    `jpeg-encoder`) with a minimal EXIF block (orientation 1–8, DateTimeOriginal, make/model,
    optional embedded thumbnail) and PNG; `demo_library(dir, folders, photos)`. (Built with the `image`
    crate's JPEG encoder, since `jpeg-encoder`'s licence includes IJG; `demo_library` returns the files
    and the caller writes them.)
  - done when: `cargo test -p dalica-scenes` shows the same seed gives identical bytes, all 8
    orientations are written, and the files decode with the `image` crate.
- ✅ **M1.5 `image`: sniffing, EXIF and orientation**
  - after: M1.4
  - files: `crates/image/src/sniff.rs`, `crates/image/src/ifd.rs`, `crates/image/src/exif.rs`, `crates/image/src/orient.rs`, `crates/image/src/limits.rs`, `crates/image/src/lib.rs`, `crates/image/Cargo.toml`
  - scope: magic-number sniffing; a bounded TIFF/IFD reader (shared later with `meta` and RAW
    previews); orientation, capture date and dimensions from headers without decoding; embedded
    EXIF thumbnail extraction; `Limits`.
  - done when: `cargo test -p dalica-image` covers a `.jpg` that is really a PNG, all 8
    orientations read from `scenes` files, looping and out-of-range IFD offsets returning `Err`,
    and a property test truncating files at every offset that never panics.
- ✅ **M1.6 `image`: decoding**
  - after: M1.5
  - files: `crates/image/src/decode.rs`, `crates/image/src/resize.rs`, `crates/image/tests/**`
  - scope: JPEG and PNG decode to RGBA8 sRGB (ICC in M8); scaled decode for thumbnails (DCT
    scaling where the decoder offers it, else decode and resize under the 64 MP cap); orientation
    applied; header bombs refused before allocation.
  - done when: each of the 8 orientations decodes upright (fingerprint equal to the orientation-1
    source); a header declaring 100 000 × 100 000 is refused without allocating; a 256 px
    thumbnail of a 24 MP scene decodes within a recorded time.
- ✅ **M1.7 `sidecar` v1**
  - after: M1.1
  - files: `crates/sidecar/**`
  - scope: the `.dalica.json` document with `photos.<name>.star`; unknown keys preserved at every
    level; wrong-type values kept and reported; BOM and CRLF accepted; duplicate keys take the
    later value; deterministic printing (sorted keys, two spaces, LF); a parse error the caller
    uses to set the file aside.
  - done when: `cargo test -p dalica-sidecar` passes property tests (`parse(print(x)) == x` for
    random documents, any file name as a key) and a planted unknown key and a wrong-type `star`
    keep their values when another photo is edited.
- ✅ **M1.8 `library` model and ops**
  - after: M1.1
  - files: `crates/library/**`
  - scope: folders, photos (name, size, mtime, dimensions, date, star), `Op` (add/remove folder,
    add/remove/update photos, set stars), `apply` returning the inverse, revisions, queries
    (photos of a folder in display order, by id).
  - done when: `cargo test -p dalica-library` passes a property test that, for random op
    sequences, applying an op and then its inverse restores the model and each apply bumps the
    revision once.
- ✅ **M1.9 `store`: journal and snapshot**
  - after: M1.2, M1.8
  - files: `crates/store/src/journal.rs`, `crates/store/src/snapshot.rs`, `crates/store/src/lib.rs`, `crates/store/Cargo.toml`
  - scope: JSON-lines journal with a checksum per line, periodic snapshot, replay that stops
    cleanly at a torn or corrupt tail.
  - done when: journal + replay reproduce the model; truncating the journal at every byte offset
    replays to the last complete op; a corrupt snapshot falls back to the journal or a rebuild
    with a reported reason.
- ✅ **M1.10 `store`: sidecar sync and rebuild**
  - after: M1.3, M1.7, M1.9
  - files: `crates/store/src/mapping.rs`, `crates/store/src/writer.rs`, `crates/store/src/rebuild.rs`, `crates/store/tests/**`
  - scope: model ↔ sidecar mapping (with the test that every user-visible model field is
    mapped); dirty folders written debounced (1 s on the `Clock`) by re-reading, merging and
    atomically replacing; `flush()`; damaged sidecars renamed `.corrupt-<time>` and their folder
    flagged read-only; `rebuild` from folders.
  - done when: star → `flush` → the sidecar holds it; planted unknown keys survive; virtual time
    shows at most one write per folder per second; delete the index → `rebuild` → the same stars
    (`data-model.md` §10.1 for stars); fault injection during a write leaves the old or the new
    sidecar (§10.5).
- ✅ **M1.11 `scan`: one-shot scan and verification**
  - after: M1.3, M1.5, M1.7, M1.8
  - files: `crates/scan/**`
  - scope: walk the watched roots through `fs`; skip rules (dot files and folders,
    `.dalica-originals`); recognise JPEG and PNG by content; read headers and sidecars; emit
    batched `Op`s; a verification pass that diffs disk against the model.
  - done when: temp-tree tests find nested folders, skip skipped folders, and after adding,
    deleting and renaming files the verification pass emits exactly the matching ops; scanning
    1 000 `scenes` JPEGs completes within a recorded time.
- ✅ **M1.12 `thumbs`: job pool and memory cache**
  - after: M1.6
  - files: `crates/thumbs/**`
  - scope: prioritised, per-key de-duplicating pool with cancellation; byte-budgeted LRU; the
    thumbnail job (decode at size, orientation applied).
  - done when: fake-job tests show strict priority order under contention, one execution per
    duplicate key, cancelled jobs never delivered, and no lost results in a 10 000-job stress run;
    the LRU never exceeds its byte budget.
- ✅ **M1.13 `engine`: Session and commands**
  - after: M1.10, M1.11
  - files: `crates/engine/src/session.rs`, `crates/engine/src/registry.rs`, `crates/engine/src/undo.rs`, `crates/engine/src/error.rs`, `crates/engine/src/lib.rs`, `crates/engine/src/cmd/**`, `crates/engine/Cargo.toml`
  - scope: `Session` (library, store, clock, lock), `CommandSpec`, `execute` (enabled check, typed
    params, `catch_unwind`, one undo step), the library undo stack (cap 1 000); commands
    `folders.add`, `library.query`, `photo.inspect`, `photo.star.toggle`, `photo.star.set`,
    `edit.undo`, `edit.redo`, `library.rebuild`.
  - done when: each command passes the command test contract (`architecture.md` §3); star 3 →
    undo → `flush` → the sidecar holds 2; a second `Session` on the same library gets `Locked`.
- ✅ **M1.14 `engine`: keymap, settings, `panic_hunt`**
  - after: M1.13
  - files: `crates/engine/src/keymap.rs`, `crates/engine/src/settings.rs`, `crates/engine/src/cmd/app.rs`, `crates/engine/tests/**`
  - scope: contexts, key parsing, defaults from specs, user overrides, resolution order, conflict
    detection, `app.setShortcut` / `app.resetShortcuts`; `settings.json` (unknown keys kept,
    damaged file set aside); `panic_hunt` over every command.
  - done when: Ctrl+1 in Library and Edit view is not a conflict while Global + Library on one key
    is; no two default bindings conflict; a rebinding survives a restart;
    `cargo test -p dalica-engine --test panic_hunt -- --ignored` is green.
- ✅ **M1.15 `dalica-cli` run and inspect**
  - after: M1.14
  - files: `apps/dalica-cli/src/run.rs`, `apps/dalica-cli/src/inspect.rs`, `apps/dalica-cli/src/main.rs`, `apps/dalica-cli/Cargo.toml`, `tests/acceptance/m1_headless.rs`, `xtask/src/accept.rs`
  - scope: `commands` (the engine registry), `run --library DIR` (JSON-lines script, one result per
    line, flush, exit 1 on a failed command and 2 on a bad script line), `inspect`;
    `cargo xtask accept M<n> --headless` runs the `m<n>_headless` test target.
  - done when: `cargo xtask accept M1 --headless` passes the data half of M1's *Done when*: 200
    `scenes` JPEGs in all orientations, star 3, undo 1 → 2 stars in `.dalica.json` with planted
    keys intact; delete the index, rebuild → 2 stars; a second process refused.
- ✅ **M1.A Checkpoint A review**
  - after: M1.15
  - owner: maintainer
  - files: —
  - scope: the maintainer runs `cargo xtask accept M1 --headless`, looks at a sidecar and the CLI
    output, and approves building the UI on top.
  - done when: the maintainer closes the review issue.
- ⬜ **M1.16 `ui-kit`: tokens, widgets, rasterizer**
  - after: M1.1
  - files: `crates/ui-kit/**`, `assets/fonts/**`, `ATTRIBUTION.md`, `crates/scenes/src/fingerprint.rs`
  - scope: M1's tokens (`chrome`, `canvas`, `grid_bg`, `cell`, `cell_selected`, text greys,
    `accent`, `icon`), the widget registry, a button, an icon button, the star icon and badge; Inter
    (Regular, SemiBold) in `assets/fonts/` with `OFL-Inter.txt` and its `ATTRIBUTION.md` row,
    installed by `ui-kit` (egui's default fonts are off); the CPU rasterizer: first check whether
    `egui_software_backend` (0.0.3 on 2026-10-09) supports egui 0.36 and matches egui's blending,
    adopt it if so, else write our own (decision and reason in the commit body). Move the image
    fingerprint helper (8 × 8 grid, per-channel mean and deviation, tolerance, actual/expected PNGs
    under `target/test-output/`) from `crates/image/tests/decode.rs` to `dalica-scenes`, for
    `image`, `ui-kit` and `ui` tests.
  - done when: `cargo test -p dalica-ui-kit` renders a widget gallery to identical pixels twice,
    matches its fingerprint, and the token contrast test passes (text on `chrome` ≥ 4.5:1).
- ⬜ **M1.17 `ui`: headless driver and snapshots**
  - after: M1.A, M1.16
  - files: `crates/ui/src/app.rs`, `crates/ui/src/state.rs`, `crates/ui/src/headless.rs`, `crates/ui/src/lib.rs`, `crates/ui/Cargo.toml`, `apps/dalica-cli/src/snapshot.rs`
  - scope: `App::run` (UI-only ids, else forwarded), a minimal `UiState`, the headless driver
    (`click`, `key`, `step_until`, `state`, `widgets`, `screenshot`) on a virtual clock,
    `dalica-cli snapshot`.
  - done when: a test drives an empty app headlessly and takes a screenshot of the requested size;
    `dalica-cli snapshot --library DIR -o out.png --size 1400x900` writes that PNG.
- ⬜ **M1.18 `ui`: the plain library window**
  - after: M1.12, M1.17
  - files: `crates/ui/src/panels/**`, `crates/ui/src/keys.rs`, `crates/ui/src/picker.rs`, `crates/ui/tests/**`, `apps/dalica/src/**`, `apps/dalica/Cargo.toml`
  - scope: folder list; one square grid per folder with thumbnails from the job pool; click
    selects; Ctrl+8 (through the keymap) and a star button; the star badge; File → Add Folder…
    through the `Picker` trait (`rfd` with only its `xdg-portal` backend in the app, since gtk3
    links C; scripted in tests); the UI-thread guard on. The window keeps OS decorations until M3's
    title bar. The app opens the `Session` off the UI thread, then marks the UI thread and calls
    `Session::poll()` every frame (scans and writes run on the engine's worker threads).
  - done when: a headless test opens a `scenes` library, clicks a thumbnail by widget id, presses
    Ctrl+8, and the photo is starred in the engine and its badge shows in the screenshot
    fingerprint; no `fs` call happens on the UI thread during the test.
- ⬜ **M1.19 Demo library and `accept M1`**
  - after: M1.18
  - files: `crates/engine/src/demo.rs`, `tests/acceptance/m1.rs`, `tests/acceptance/m1.md`, `apps/dalica/src/main.rs`, `apps/dalica-cli/src/main.rs`
  - scope: `--demo` (in `dalica` and `dalica-cli`) builds a throwaway `scenes` library, written
    through `fs` (`scenes` itself never writes); the full acceptance test, reusing the steps of
    `m1_headless.rs` and adding the snapshot; the manual check written down; metrics in the dev log
    (the lead copies them to `status.md`).
  - done when: `cargo xtask accept M1` passes everything in M1's *Done when*.
- ⬜ **M1.R Milestone review**
  - after: M1.19
  - owner: maintainer
  - files: `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/status.md`
  - scope: the maintainer does the manual check (star with Ctrl+8, restart, badge still there),
    reviews what was learned, and approves the M2 task list.
  - done when: the maintainer closes the review issue.

### M2 — Agent eyes

- **Goal:** agents can drive and look at the real window, not only the headless one.
- **In:** widget ids on everything M1 draws; the complete headless driver (`click`, `drag`, `key`,
  `type_text`, `step_until`, `state`, `widgets`, `screenshot`); serialisable `UiState`; the control
  channel (`--control`, token, loopback only, limits) with `engine.execute`, `engine.commands`,
  `ui.state` / `ui.set`, `ui.widgets`, `ui.clickWidget`, `ui.pointer`, `ui.key`, `ui.type`,
  `ui.screenshot` (window, headless fallback), `ui.inspect` (perf counters), `ui.settle` /
  `ui.wait`; `dalica-cli snapshot --script`; `DALICA_PROFILE=1`.
- **Out:** MCP (M21), menu methods (need M3's menus), new features.
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M2` runs a control session against a headless instance (auth,
  click a thumbnail, Ctrl+8, screenshot) and checks the star and the PNG fingerprint; the
  protocol's security tests pass (wrong token, oversized line, non-loopback bind refused). You
  start `dalica --control 7990 --demo` and an agent's screenshot matches your screen.

### M3 — Window shell

- **Goal:** the main window has every region of `ui-layout.md` §2 at the specified size, in the
  Craft look.
- **In:** all `Tokens` of `design-system.md`; the widget set (buttons, icon buttons, segmented
  buttons, slider, text field, dropdown, menus, tooltips, splitter); shell icons drawn in code; the
  menu bar from the full menu catalog (unregistered items disabled; native macOS menu); the
  toolbar (controls present, inactive ones disabled); tree pane and splitter (resizable,
  persisted); status line; bottom area (tray box, star and rotate buttons, size slider, pane
  toggles, action buttons with More… overflow); side-pane frame; window state persisted;
  responsiveness rules (§11); F11; `ui.menu.tree` / `ui.menu.invoke`; per-platform default keys
  (Redo is Cmd+Shift+Z on macOS).
- **Out:** real tree and grid behaviour (M4, M5), pane contents, rooms.
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M3`: geometry tests read every region's rect from the widget
  registry at 1400 × 900 and 900 × 600 and match `ui-layout.md` §2 and §11; token contrast tests;
  widget-gallery fingerprints; every menu item of `menus-and-shortcuts.md` §1 is present in order.
  You open the app at both sizes and compare with the docs.

### M4 — Light table

- **Goal:** the continuous, sectioned light table of `ui-layout.md` §5, smooth at 100 k photos.
- **In:** sections in tree order; section header block (icon, title, date and place, buttons with
  inactive ones disabled, description line); justified square-cell grid; badges; thumbnail caption
  modes; hidden/small-picture drawing rules; sticky headers; section scrollbar (⇑ ▲ ▼ ⇓); size
  slider, Ctrl+wheel, Ctrl+1 / Ctrl+2; hover tooltip; empty states; layout cached per revision;
  texture eviction.
- **Out:** selection beyond M1's click (M6); section-header actions (their own milestones); inline
  description editing (M9).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M4`: a headless benchmark scrolls a synthetic 100 k-photo
  library at ≤ 8 ms/frame p95 UI time (recorded in `status.md` → Metrics) and cells visited per
  frame stay flat from 10 k to 100 k; layout tests for column justification and sticky-header
  push-up; section-jump tests. You scroll the demo library.

### M5 — Library tree

- **Goal:** the left pane of `ui-layout.md` §4.
- **In:** groups (Folders, Other, Hidden Folders; Albums and People appear empty until their
  milestones); flat and tree modes; year dividers; folder sorting and reverse; the view-options
  popup; click = scroll that section's header to the top (animated) and select the folder as a
  unit; collapsing a group hides its sections; ↑/↓ and ←/→; middle elision; counts.
- **Out:** album and people rows (M17, M29), drop targets (M19), Hide Folder (M9).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M5`: tree rows and order match a fixture library in both
  modes and every sort; a row click leaves its header at the top (scroll offset) and selects the
  folder; collapsing Folders removes its sections; a 5 k-folder library stays within the frame
  budget.

### M6 — Selection and the Photo Tray

- **Goal:** the selection model and the tray of `ui-layout.md` §5.4 and §6.
- **In:** click, Ctrl-click, Shift range, rubber band, scoped to one section; keyboard navigation
  (arrows, Home/End, Ctrl+Home/End, Ctrl+↑/↓, PgUp/PgDn); Ctrl+A / D / I; Select Starred; the tray
  (live mirror, folder token, mini thumbnails that shrink with count, tray selection); Hold
  (Ctrl+H) and the held badge; Clear with confirmation; every status-line state; bottom star and
  rotate buttons act on the tray; "Select some photos first".
- **Out:** Add to Album ▾ (M17), dragging into or out of the tray (M19), tray context-menu items
  of later milestones (shown disabled).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M6`: select 2 in folder A, Hold, select 3 in folder B → the
  tray has 5 → star all 5 in one undo step → undo restores all 5; status-line strings match each
  case of §6.1; keyboard navigation stops at section edges.

### M7 — Folders and scanning

- **Goal:** the library follows the user's folders by itself (`data-model.md` §7,
  `organizing.md` §1–2).
- **In:** Folder Manager (roots and volumes loaded lazily, Scan Always / Scan Once / Remove,
  inheritance, watched list, confirmations); first-run panel; `notify` watching + periodic
  verification; external creates, deletes, renames and modifications; folders moved outside Dalica
  keep their data; offline volumes (dimmed, cached thumbnails, queued edits written on return);
  skip rules; the disk thumbnail cache (2 GiB, pruning); the activity indicator with its job list
  and Cancel; scan progress on the status line; stale `.dalica-tmp-*` cleanup (`security.md` §5.8);
  writes relative to a held folder handle (`security.md` §5.6, through `rustix`; approved at M1.A).
- **Out:** new formats (M8), legacy sidecars (M33), face finding (M29).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M7`: temp-dir scenarios (add, remove, rename while running;
  the verification pass finds everything; a volume "unplugged" by renaming its root shows offline,
  a star made meanwhile is written when it returns); benchmark: first thumbnails of a 10 k-JPEG
  folder ≤ 1 s, full scan time recorded. You run first-run on a fresh library directory and watch
  thumbnails fill in.

### M8 — Formats and colour

- **Goal:** every format of `formats.md` §1 shows correctly and safely.
- **In:** TIFF, WebP, GIF, BMP, JPEG XL, PSD composite, RAW embedded previews (our own IFD walker),
  CMYK and 16-bit sources, ICC through `moxcms`, decode limits on every path, "!" tiles with
  reasons, HEIF behind the `heif` feature, View → Use Color Management, `cargo xtask corpus` with
  floors, a fuzz target per parser, TIFF-strip EXIF thumbnails.
- **Out:** writing metadata (M10), video (M34), AVIF (no decoder available).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M8`: decode tests per format from `scenes` at several depths
  and profiles; orientation 1–8 per container; malformed-input property tests never panic; corpus
  floors hold; a mixed-format folder snapshot matches its fingerprint.

### M9 — Photo info

- **Goal:** the light organizing a user does on single photos and folders, stored in sidecars.
- **In:** rotate CW/CCW from the library (recipe op, rotated thumbnails; the first `edit`
  operations: rotate and flip); hide/unhide photos and folders, View → Hidden Pictures, the Hidden
  Folders group; captions (inline editing in the library, Thumbnail Caption modes); folder
  description editing in the header; Folder Properties (date, place, description); the Properties
  pane (read-only metadata, Show All Metadata); Adjust Date and Time.
- **Out:** writing into files (M10), the edit view (M12), renaming folders (M19).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M9`: the command contract for every new command; rotated
  thumbnail fingerprints; hide, captions and dates survive a rebuild. You rotate, hide and caption
  photos in the app.

### M10 — Tags and metadata write-back

- **Goal:** tags in the UI, and captions, tags and dates written into the photo files without ever
  harming them (`xmp-interop.md`).
- **In:** tag commands and the Tags pane (add, partial counts, remove, quick tags and their
  dialog, Ctrl+Alt+1…0, Rename Tag); `meta` write-back for JPEG, PNG, WebP and TIFF; the metadata
  write queue with re-read, merge and verify; the conflict rules of `xmp-interop.md` §5; importing
  file metadata on first scan; `.xmp` sidecars for RAW (option); the metadata corpus.
- **Out:** face regions (M30), the GPS user interface (M31).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M10`: `xmp-interop.md` §8 tests 1–4 and 6–10 pass; files
  written by other applications in the corpus keep every non-owned byte after a Dalica write. You
  tag a photo in Dalica and see the tag in another photo application.

### M11 — Release 0.1 (organizer preview)

- **Goal:** something installable to try on real folders.
- **In:** the release workflow (draft releases with checksums); Linux AppImage, Flatpak and deb/rpm, Windows
  MSI/zip, macOS DMG (unsigned where there are no credentials); About window with credits; the
  user-facing `whats-new.md`; README status banner; the application id (reserved decision 10).
- **Out:** signing without credentials, update checks (deferred).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M11`: a CI dry run builds the artifacts on all three OSes and
  the checksums match. You install it and browse your own photos.

### M12 — Edit view shell

- **Goal:** open a photo and move around in it (`editing.md` §1–3, §5.1–5.2).
- **Prerequisite:** decide the coordinate frame (`data-model.md` §3.3).
- **In:** layout (top bar, filmstrip, edit panel with tab placeholders, photo area, caption bar,
  Histogram & Camera Info); entering and leaving (double-click, Enter, Ctrl+3, Esc, Ctrl+1);
  previous/next; zoom and pan maths, Fit / 1:1, background refinement; the per-photo history
  commands with labelled Undo/Redo buttons; star, rotate and flip in the edit view as history steps.
- **Out:** tools and effects (M13+), compare modes (M26), video (M34).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M12`: zoom maths tests (ends and midpoint = 100 %); navigation
  tests; a photo's history survives a restart; opening a 24 MP JPEG renders its screen preview in
  ≤ 150 ms (recorded).

### M13 — Basic fixes

- **Goal:** the Basic Fixes tab, and edits shown everywhere (`editing.md` §6).
- **In:** the `edit` renderer with pipeline order and per-operation versions; thumbnails show
  edits (recipe in cache keys); Crop (ratios, custom ratios, Manual, rotate, preview; suggestions
  from thirds/saliency); Straighten; Auto Fix, Auto Contrast, Auto Color; the Fill Light slider.
- **Out:** face-based crop suggestions (M29), Retouch (M14).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M13`: fingerprints per operation; resolution independence (two
  sizes agree after downscale); thumbnail render = edit-view render; unknown operations survive.

### M14 — Tuning and retouch

- **In:** the Tuning tab as one live-updated operation (one undo step per tab session), Auto
  lighting and Auto color, the Neutral Color Picker; the Retouch tool with in-tool patch undo.
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M14`: a slider drag updates the screen preview in ≤ 16 ms
  draft (recorded); a whole drag is one history step; fingerprints per control.

### M15 — Save to disk

- **Goal:** the only path that changes pixels, with the original always recoverable
  (`data-model.md` §6).
- **In:** Save (first-time dialog, originals backup, quality matching, metadata carried over),
  Undo Save, Revert, Save a Copy, Save As; the folder header's Save button and "n edited";
  lossless JPEG rotation (or the EXIF flag fallback); non-writable formats → JPEG beside.
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M15`: Save → Undo Save → Save → Revert returns the exact
  original bytes (`data-model.md` §10.9); fault injection during Save never loses the original;
  every format of `formats.md` §1 saves as specified.

### M16 — Export

- **In:** the Export dialog (`creating.md` §2), the background export job with progress and
  Cancel, resize, quality presets, watermark, metadata copy and optional GPS removal, collision
  names, the Exported project group, adding an unwatched export folder.
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M16`: exported files are decoded and checked (size, quality
  bounds, metadata, GPS removed when asked); Cancel leaves only complete files; a 200-photo export
  of a mixed tray succeeds.

### M17 — Albums

- **In:** user albums (New Album, properties, add via tray, context menu or drop on an album row,
  remove, manual order with position keys (re-keying an album when a key would pass 512 bytes,
  `data-model.md` §3.2), Sort Album By, cover, delete); Starred Photos and
  Recently Updated; the Albums group and album sections; the Album menu variant.
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M17`: `data-model.md` §10.12 (cross-folder order survives a
  rebuild); undo for every album command.

### M18 — Search and filters

- **In:** the search grammar, instant search on a worker with debounce, autocomplete, the filter
  buttons and age slider, search mode (banner, Show All, scroll restore), the temporary results
  album, Save Search as Album, Find Duplicates (identical files).
- **Out:** `color:` search and `person:` before People (decided at this milestone's review).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M18`: grammar tests; search of 100 k photos answers within its
  budget (recorded); the banner text and counts match the spec.

### M19 — File operations

- **In:** move (drag onto a tree folder, Cut/Paste), copy, the collision dialog, Move to New
  Folder, Split Folder Here, move/rename/delete folder, Rename and batch rename, delete to the
  trash, the drag pill; sidecar entries and originals backups travel with their photos; undo where
  possible; "don't ask again" settings.
- **Out:** dragging out to other applications (M36).
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M19`: `data-model.md` §10.2, §10.3 and §10.7; undo tests per
  operation; a move across two file systems copies, verifies, then deletes.

### M20 — Preferences and shortcuts

- **In:** the Options dialog (tabs; OK / Cancel / Apply rules); General, File Types and Export tabs;
  UI scale and font size; the shortcut editor (`menus-and-shortcuts.md` §2.0) and Help → Keyboard
  Shortcuts.
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M20`: settings round-trip with unknown keys kept; keymap
  conflict tests; rebinding Star to F8 through `app.setShortcut` and pressing F8 headless stars
  the photo; Reset All restores every default.

### M21 — MCP and workflows

- **In:** `dalica-cli mcp` (headless and connect modes), one tool per command plus helpers, roots
  and permissions (`mcp.md`); workflow acceptance tests for every P0 flow.
- **Done when:** `cargo xtask accept M21`: every P0 workflow passes over MCP in CI; the behaviour
  pass rate is recorded in *Where we stand*.

### M22 — Release 0.2 (P0 complete)

- **Done when:** every P0 parity row is ✅ with evidence; P0 workflows pass 100 %; performance
  budgets for P0 scenarios are enforced; an honest *Where we stand*; a 0.2 release.

### M23 – M33: P1 parity (outline; detailed at the reviews)

| # | In | Done when (sketch) |
|---|---|---|
| M23 Import | rooms/tab strip; sources (cards, removable drives, folders); time grouping; exclude duplicates; destination and folder naming; copy-verify; optional removal from the card | import of a simulated card into dated folders; duplicates skipped; no file overwritten |

### M34 – M37: Finish (outline)

| # | In | Done when (sketch) |
|---|---|---|
| M34 Video | reserved decision 2 first; then poster frames, playback, trim, frame save — or descope to tiles | decided and recorded; tests per chosen scope |
| M35 Localisation and accessibility | translation catalogs, AccessKit labels, screen-reader and keyboard-only passes, scaling | coverage per language reported; AccessKit tree tests |
| M36 OS integration | drag out to other apps, clipboard files, Open With ▸, external editor, Locate on Disk with selection, default-viewer registration, MTP/PTP cameras | per-OS manual checklist plus what can be tested per OS in CI |
| M37 Release 1.0 | signed packages, full honest assessment, release notes | the release checklist (`releasing.md`) |

## Reserved decisions (the maintainer's, not the agents')

Record the decision here with a date when made.

1. Reuse model. **Decided 2026-10-09: reference only.** LightCraft and PhotoCraft are prior art for
   technology, look and methodology; no Craft code is depended on or vendored. crates.io
   libraries stay allowed after the dependency check (`architecture.md` §9).
2. Video: pure-Rust decoding vs optional external process (M34).
3. Metadata write defaults. **Decided 2026-10-09:** captions, tags, places and date changes are
   written into the photo files' metadata by default (pixels never change without Save); stars as
   XMP ratings off.
4. Map tiles provider and whether maps are on by default (M31).
5. Face-recognition models and their licences (M29).
6. Password-protected hidden folders. **Decided 2026-10-09: no.**
7. Licence. **Decided 2026-10-09: MIT OR Apache-2.0**, the same as PhotoCraft.
8. Community process (Discord/GitHub Discussions) and release cadence. The repository is public.
9. TLS stack for the few network features (map tiles, model downloads): a pure-Rust provider vs
   accepting `ring`, or delegating downloads to the OS. See `security.md` (M29).
10. Application id (reverse-DNS, used by packaging, desktop files and the settings path) (M11).
11. Coordinate frame for normalised coordinates (`data-model.md` §3.3) (M12).
