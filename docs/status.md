# Status

Where the project stands right now, for agents and humans. The **lead** keeps it current (workers
report numbers in their PRs). Live task state is on the task board (`cargo xtask tasks status`,
[`task-board.md`](task-board.md)); the narrative history is the private dev log (`log/devlog.md`)
and git.

## Current

- **Milestone:** M0 (not started)
- **Next task:** M0.1 — workspace skeleton (`roadmap.md` → M0 tasks; single agent until the task
  board exists, M0.10)
- **Blockers:** none (reuse model and licence decided 2026-10-09).
